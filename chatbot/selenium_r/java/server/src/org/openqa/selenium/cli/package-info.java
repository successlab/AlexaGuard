/**
 * <p>Mechanisms to configure and run selenium via the command line. There
 * are two key classes {@link org.openqa.selenium.cli.CliCommand} and
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.HasRoles}. Ultimately, these are used to
 * build a {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.Config} instance, for
 * which there are strongly-typed role-specific classes that use a
 * {@code Config}, such as
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.docker.DockerOptions}.
 *
 * <p>Assuming your {@code CliCommand} extends
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridCommand}, the process for
 * building the set of flags to use is:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The default flags are added (these are
 *    {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.server.HelpFlags} and
 *    {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigFlags}
 *   <li>{@link java.util.ServiceLoader} is used to find all implementations
 *    of {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.HasRoles} where
 *    {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.HasRoles#getRoles()} is contained
 *    within {@link org.openqa.selenium.cli.CliCommand#getConfigurableRoles()}.
 *   <li>Finally all flags returned by
 *     {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridCommand#getFlagObjects()}
 *     are added.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The flags are then used by JCommander to parse the command arguments.
 * Once that's done, the raw flags are converted to a
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.Config} by combining all of the
 * flag objects with system properties and environment variables. This
 * implies that each flag object has annotated each field with
 * {@link org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigValue}.
 *
 * <p>Ultimately, this means that flag objects have all (most?) fields
 * annotated with JCommander's {@link com.beust.jcommander.Parameter}
 * annotation as well as {@code ConfigValue}.
